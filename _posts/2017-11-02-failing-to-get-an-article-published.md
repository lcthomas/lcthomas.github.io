Not much to say about this one: I recently had an article about critical reading practices rejected for publication. I think in this case it was mainly a situation where the article wasn&#8217;t the right fit for the venue, but I don&#8217;t know for sure. I know rejection is a totally normal part of the job, and this rejection was not mean-spirited or unfair &#8212; but it still stings, right?

I know I should just send it somewhere else. And while there are some parts of the thing that are fine, I want to make some changes &#8212; ok, I want to change the article entirely &#8212; and I don&#8217;t have time to do that right now. It&#8217;s a one-off piece and I really just gotta finish this book. Yet it&#8217;s still bothersome: I&#8217;m not particularly attached to the article itself in its current configuration, but I AM attached to the many hours I spent writing the damn thing, and to the idea of having written it.

Maybe, in the utopian dream that is &#8220;next summer,&#8221; I will find the time to resuscitate the article and do something with it. And/or maybe pieces of it will just end up on this blog while I figure out what to do, little bits of mess.
