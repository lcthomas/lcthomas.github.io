### Book Projects
- "Training for Catastrophe: National Security and the Use of Fiction After 9/11." Manuscript in progress. Investigates the use of fiction as a mode of knowledge production within contemporary US national security discourse, arguing that this dependence on fiction – at once strange, remarkable, and unsettling – is a political tool for shaping how we imagine and respond to catastrophe today.
