### Book
- [*Training for Catastrophe: National Security and the Use of Fiction After 9/11*](https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/training-for-catastrophe){:target="_blank"}. University of Minnesota Press, 2021. Investigates the use of fiction as a mode of knowledge production within contemporary US national security discourse, arguing that this dependence on fiction – at once strange, remarkable, and unsettling – is a political tool for shaping how we imagine and respond to catastrophe today.
