</header>
<p>I am assistant professor of English at the University of Miami. I research and teach at the intersections of cultural and media studies, contemporary US literature, and the digital humanities. I'm currently working on a book manuscript about how the national security state uses fiction to produce knowledge about future threats, titled "Training for Catastrophe: National Security and the Use of Fiction after 9/11" (under contract with the University of Minnesota Press). I'm also a co-director of <a href="http://we1s.ucsb.edu/", target="_blank">WhatEvery1Says</a>, a project that examines contemporary public discourse about the humanities on a large scale.</p>
