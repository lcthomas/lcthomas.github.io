</header>
<p>I am Associate Professor in the Department of Literatures in English at Cornell University. I research and teach at the intersections of cultural and media studies, contemporary US literature, and the digital humanities. My book is <a href="https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/training-for-catastrophe" target="_blank"><i>Training for Catastrophe: Fictions of National Security after 9/11</i></a> (University of Minnesota Press, 2021), which won the 2021 Book Prize for the Association for the Study of the Arts of the Present. I was also a co-director of <a href="http://we1s.ucsb.edu/", target="_blank">WhatEvery1Says</a>, a project that employed machine learning techniques to examine contemporary public discourse about the humanities on a large scale.</p>
